# ValuationModel

In this project, I created an automated private company valuation model, aiming to streamline and expedite a time-consuming and complex process. The problem addressed is the reliance on manual calculations, data collection, and subjective judgment in private company valuation, leading to inefficiency and potential errors. The development of the automated private company valuation mode addresses the inefficiencies and subjectivity inherent in traditional manual valuation processes. The project streamlines the valuation process by integrating multiple valuation methods, such as Backsolve Option Pricing, Discounted Cash Flows, and Comparative Analysis, into a comprehensive Excel-based model. By automating data collection and calculation processes, the model reduces valuation time from days to hours while ensuring reliability and accuracy. This project offers investors, decision-makers, and strategic planners a reliable tool to assess the value of private companies efficiently.

This assignment was instrumental in bridging the gap between my computer science and business skills by delving into VBA coding and creating a valuation model, which extended my knowledge from business classes. ChatGPT played a pivotal role by assisting in coding and problem-solving, especially considering my novice status in VBA. Initially, certain aspects of the project, like developing the Backsolve macro, seemed daunting. However, diving into the task revealed that my preparatory work had equipped me better than I realized, teaching me the value of thorough preparation and overcoming the fear of tackling unfamiliar challenges. Learning VBA has not only expanded my skill set but also promises immediate applications in my upcoming summer stint in real estate investments, where Excel proficiency is paramount. Furthermore, it distinguishes me in the finance field, providing an edge over peers lacking similar technical expertise.
